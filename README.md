# IMMLU: Benchmark for Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Indian Languages

## Introduction
IMMLU (Indian Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is an open-source project dedicated to establishing a benchmark for evaluating language understanding in a variety of Indian languages. Drawing inspiration from the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) framework, this initiative aims to address the complexities and unique characteristics of Indian languages in the domain of natural language processing (NLP).

## Project Purpose
The core purpose of IMMLU is to develop a comprehensive benchmark that rigorously tests and measures the capabilities of language models across a wide range of language understanding tasks, specifically tailored to the linguistic diversity of India. We are starting with the languages below, but there is a possibility of expanding to more languages later.

- Tamil
- Hindi
- Telugu
- Kannada
- Malayalam
