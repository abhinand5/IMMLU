# Contributing to the IMMLU Dataset
There are three ways for you to contribute to this open source initiative.

## 1. Uploading Original Content (Coming soon)

Upload questions in your native language from textbooks using Google forms (form coming soon) or as images (coming soon).

## 2. Evaluate translated content

Go to (app link coming soon), read the question and answer choices thoroughly. Rate them on the following measures:
    
    * Translation accuracy
    * Correctness of the answer

## 3. Translate MMLU in your native language

If you are familiar with Python, you can clone this repo, download the MMLU dataset from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lighteval/mmlu), translate the questions into your native language using the translation API of your choice (see: [google_translate_api_examples](notebooks/google_translate_api_examples.ipynb) notebook for example), and upload your results as CSV or JSON. It will be entered in our dataset for manual evaluation. Once it's accepted by reviewers, the questions will be added to the dataset.
